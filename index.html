            <p>
                Hello! I’m Angad Hundal, a Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University with a keen interest 
                in numerical analysis and applied mathematics. Outside the classroom, I stay active in my community 
                through volunteer work with the Surrey Crime Prevention Society and the Adopt a Street Program—
                experiences that have strengthened my passion for service and teamwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not studying or volunteering, you’ll find me playing soccer, discovering new music, or 
                planning my next travel adventure. I’m driven by a desire to use technology and math-driven 
                solutions to make a positive impact on the world around me.

            <h3>Volunteer at Surrey Crime Prevention Society (SCPS)</h3>
            <a href="https://www.preventcrime.ca/">Learn more about them here</a>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2020 - Present</p>
            <p>
                I go on foot tours around Fleetwood (the city where I live) and report illegal 
                findings/ happenings like damage to city property, drug use, and violence. 
                It has provided me the opportunity to learn about keeping the neighborhood safe & 
                pay back to the community. It has allowed me to hone my skills like teamwork, 
                leadership, collaboration, respect for others, empathy and leadership skills like 
                providing feedback & appreciation for other people's work & efforts.

            <h3>Adopt a Street Program</h3>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2021 - Present</p>
            <p>
                I go around on designated streets around the neighborhood cleaning up litter/ garbage on
                 the sidewalk & take notes of any hazardous items that I may see & share with the city 
                 authorities. It instills values of humility, empathy, care and affirms spiritual values of 
                 “seva” (service to the world/ nature) that my family always inculcated. The words of thanks 
                 and appreciation that I hear from residents fill me with happiness, gratitude & fulfillment.

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoy a variety of music genres, but rap and hip-hop have a special place for me. 
                    Some of my favorite artists include Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Travis Scott. 
                    Their lyricism, storytelling, and production are top-notch, and they all bring a different 
                    vibe to their music. Kendrick's deep, socially-conscious bars, J. Cole's introspective flow, 
                    and Travis Scott's futuristic soundscapes make for a powerful blend.

                <h3>Sports</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ve always been passionate about soccer, both playing and following the sport closely. 
                    I play regularly as a midfielder, and I enjoy the balance between offense and defense in that 
                    position. Being able to control the tempo of the game and link up play between the back line and 
                    the forwards is something I love. As for teams, I’m a huge fan of FC Barcelona. Their style of 
                    play, the famous tiki-taka approach, and their history of developing world-class talent through 
                    La Masia make them a fascinating team to follow.

                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <p>
                    Traveling has always been something I’m passionate about because it’s an incredible way to 
                    experience new cultures, people, and landscapes. One of the most memorable trips I’ve taken 
                    was to Spain. I visited cities like Barcelona, Madrid, and Seville. In Barcelona, walking down 
                    La Rambla and seeing Gaudí’s masterpiece, La Sagrada Família, was absolutely breathtaking. The 
                    mix of modernist architecture with rich historical sites like Park Güell made it a perfect blend 
                    of culture and beauty. And of course, catching a game at Camp Nou was a dream come true for a 
                    Barcelona fan like me.
