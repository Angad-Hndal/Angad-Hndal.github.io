            <h3>Volunteer at Surrey Crime Prevention Society (SCPS)</h3>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2020 - Present</p>
            <p>
                I participate in foot tours around Fleetwood, reporting issues such as
                property damage, drug use, and violence. This role has enhanced my teamwork,
                leadership, and communication skills while contributing to community safety.

            <p>
                I assist with street clean-ups by removing litter and reporting hazardous
                items. This experience instills values of humility and service, reinforcing
                community engagement and environmental care.

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoy a variety of music genres, but rap and hip-hop have a special place for me. 
                    Some of my favorite artists include Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Travis Scott. 
                    Their lyricism, storytelling, and production are top-notch, and they all bring a different 
                    vibe to their music. Kendrick's deep, socially-conscious bars, J. Cole's introspective flow, 
                    and Travis Scott's futuristic soundscapes make for a powerful blend.

                <h3>Sports</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ve always been passionate about soccer, both playing and following the sport closely. 
                    I play regularly as a midfielder, and I enjoy the balance between offense and defense in that 
                    position. Being able to control the tempo of the game and link up play between the back line and 
                    the forwards is something I love. As for teams, I’m a huge fan of FC Barcelona. Their style of 
                    play, the famous tiki-taka approach, and their history of developing world-class talent through 
                    La Masia make them a fascinating team to follow.

                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <p>
                    Traveling has always been something I’m passionate about because it’s an incredible way to 
                    experience new cultures, people, and landscapes. One of the most memorable trips I’ve taken 
                    was to Spain. I visited cities like Barcelona, Madrid, and Seville. In Barcelona, walking down 
                    La Rambla and seeing Gaudí’s masterpiece, La Sagrada Família, was absolutely breathtaking. The 
                    mix of modernist architecture with rich historical sites like Park Güell made it a perfect blend 
                    of culture and beauty. And of course, catching a game at Camp Nou was a dream come true for a 
                    Barcelona fan like me.
